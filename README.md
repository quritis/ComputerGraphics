2. Content of your project

I did the first homework in tizen. So I do the term project in tizen. Making tizen application will be hard thing to me. But I will try it. Here is content of my project.

Alphajin (오목 game application)
- This is the game application. 오목
- User or computer play the game.
- The game has same rule as 오목(33, 5 stones-win, and etc)
- With proper algorithm, computer(alphajin) play the game.
- 'Game board' and 'go stone' made of 3D computer graphics.
- These objects may have some textile or nice color.
- I want to draw the object lively.

3. Added content
I have several feedbacks from TA. So I decided to edit my plan. Major edited part is below.

 By using unity, one of the famous game engines, make better computer graphics to tizen app.

So, I will study unity. That doesn't seem to be easy, but i'll try that.
